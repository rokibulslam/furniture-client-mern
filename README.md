* Now using Redux is enjoyable for me. But boilerplate code is too much. In my next project I definitely use Redux Toolkit & RTK Query.
* Can develope authentication system with firebase.
* Dashboard Management with user/admin was challanging for me because of google login & register user. I learn a lot from here such as local storage give me a solution.
* Specially lots of backend knowladge is on my basket. Such as mongoDB query, middleware, Express the tiny framework but very powerfull.
### Lots of error, undefined takes my time but gives me lots of knowladge, experience for my future project.
