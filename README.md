# Welocome To my Websites Frontend Repository

Here is my Project Link [MY HOME](https://real-state-mern.web.app/).

### This is a MERN stack project

### Technology Used: 
* React, Redux, Redux Thunk, Redux Persist, React router v@6,  Bootstrap, Material UI, Context API.
* NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB
* Payment Gateway(Stripe), Firebase Authentication, 
* Fontawesome Icon, React Icon, 

### Features & Acheivement
* I designed and developed a user interface that dynamically adjusts to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring optimal user experience. Additionally, I created a login system that prioritizes security for both users and administrators, complete with distinct dashboards for each group.

* In the admin dashboard, administrators have the ability to modify user and moderator roles, as well as create, update, and delete products. They can also update order statuses as needed.

* Users, on the other hand, have access to a dashboard that allows them to add items to their shopping cart, pay securely using Stripe, view their order statuses, and provide feedback through product reviews.

* To create a smooth and efficient user experience, I utilized reusable components and implemented form validation. Additionally, I prioritized user-friendly error handling and built robust REST APIs to ensure seamless communication between the different parts of the system.


### Major Challenges:
* User management: This includes creating user roles such as admin and moderator, and managing registered users, as well as those who sign in using third-party authentication services like Google. Updating and securely storing user information in a database.
* Payment Processing: This involves implementing secure payment methods and ensuring that all transactions are properly recorded and tracked


### Thank you for your valuable time
